description: "Install FetchBrain SDK in your project"
---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript 5+ (recommended)
- Crawlee 3+ (optional, for enhanced crawler)

## Install via Package Manager

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @fetchbrain.com/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @fetchbrain.com/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @fetchbrain.com/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## TypeScript Setup

The SDK is fully typed. No additional `@types` packages needed.

```typescript
import { FetchBrain } from "@fetchbrain.com/sdk";
import type { FetchBrainConfig, QueryResult } from "@fetchbrain.com/sdk";
```

## Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in environment variables:

```bash .env
FETCHBRAIN_API_KEY=fb_live_your_api_key_here
```

Then use it in your code:

```typescript
const ai = new FetchBrain({
  apiKey: process.env.FETCHBRAIN_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Verify Installation

```typescript
import { FetchBrain } from "@fetchbrain.com/sdk";

const ai = new FetchBrain({
  apiKey: process.env.FETCHBRAIN_API_KEY!,
});

// Test connection
const stats = await ai.stats();
console.log("Connected! Usage:", stats);
```

## Peer Dependencies

If using with Crawlee, install it separately:

```bash
npm install crawlee
```

The SDK works with:

- `CheerioCrawler`
- `PlaywrightCrawler`
- `PuppeteerCrawler`
- Any Crawlee-compatible crawler
