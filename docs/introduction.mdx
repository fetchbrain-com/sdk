# Welcome to FetchBrain

FetchBrain uses a neural network continuously trained on millions of web pages. **Ask first → Get instant results.** AI doesn't know? → We fetch & learn for next time.

## How It Works

```
Your Scraper → FetchBrain SDK → AI knows? → YES → Return AI knowledge (skip request)
                              → NO  → Run scraper → AI learns for next time
```

1. **Before each request**, FetchBrain queries the AI if it "knows" the URL
2. **AI knows**: Return data instantly from neural inference, skip HTTP request
3. **AI learning**: Run your scraper normally, then teach the AI
