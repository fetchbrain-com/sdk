description: "Configure AI confidence thresholds"

## Overview

Intelligence levels control the AI's confidence threshold for returning known data vs suggesting a fresh scrape.

## Available Levels

| Level      | Description                         | Best For                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `realtime` | Live AI inference, highest accuracy | Critical data, real-time prices |
| `high`     | High confidence responses (default) | Most use cases                  |
| `standard` | Balanced accuracy and speed         | High-volume scraping            |
| `deep`     | Deep knowledge, broader coverage    | Historical data                 |

## Usage

```typescript
const crawler = FetchBrain.enhance(crawler, {
  apiKey: process.env.FETCHBRAIN_API_KEY,
  intelligence: "high", // Default
});
```

## Choosing the Right Level

### `realtime`

- Highest accuracy, may be slower
- Best for: stock prices, inventory levels, time-sensitive data
- Trade-off: Lower recognition rate

### `high` (Recommended)

- High confidence threshold
- Best for: product pages, articles, general scraping
- Trade-off: Good balance of speed and accuracy

### `standard`

- Balanced accuracy and speed
- Best for: large-scale scraping, less critical data
- Trade-off: May return slightly stale data

### `deep`

- Broader knowledge coverage
- Best for: historical data, archive scraping
- Trade-off: May include older versions

## Example

```typescript
// High-frequency price monitoring
const priceMonitor = FetchBrain.enhance(crawler, {
  intelligence: "realtime",
});

// General product catalog
const catalogScraper = FetchBrain.enhance(crawler, {
  intelligence: "high",
});

// Archive scraping
const archiveScraper = FetchBrain.enhance(crawler, {
  intelligence: "deep",
});
```
